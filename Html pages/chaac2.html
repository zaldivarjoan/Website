            The Mayans agricultural practices and rituals are also a key factor
            particularly their use of almanacs to predict the weather and its
            impact to their crops. The chacs, both good and negative, who are
            said to regulate the weather are described in these almanacs. The
            almanacs mention the many gifts presented to the chacs, such as corn
            and other sorts of animals. The Book of Chilam Balam has allusions
            to agricultural rites as well as calendars that predict good and bad
            days for each month of the year. Although the glyphic inscriptions
            of the Dresden Codex are written in complicated, generally unclear
            language, it is clear that the ancient. Deities possessed both
            benevolent and malevolent qualities, notably the chacs and balams,
            which are both linked with the field and bush, as well as fertility.

            The persistence and change of agricultural rituals in the Yucatan.
            Agricultural rites were practiced on the Yucatán Peninsula during
            the Colonial Period, despite a scarcity of evidence in
            sixteenth-century sources. In an 1813 account, according to the
            book, Granado Baeza, a parish priest in Yaxcabá, gives insight into
            the agricultural rites during the Colonial Period. Baeza describes a
            ceremony called "tich" or "cornfield mass" in this report, which was
            an imitation of the real mass and included elements like building an
            altar table, preparing ceremonial masa, sacrificing a turkey,
            invoking certain saints and the pahauteas, offering to the world
            directions, and feasting. The Baeza's report is crucial because it
            demonstrates that the ritual in 1813 is very similar to the chha
            chac ceremony that is still conducted today, with common features
            enduring across time. The only reading that I can compare this part
            of the book to is Día de Los Muertos where there is basically a
            ceremony with set practices for people. Overall I’ve learned that
            chaac or more known as chac takes various forms and plays an
            important role to the Mayans and their lifestyle which will either
            benefit them or not.
